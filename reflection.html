                <h3><b>Main Problems:</b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Host Service: Initially, I started with free linux hosting service which I paid for but I couldn't host my files and fixed this by switching to bytehost</li>
                    <li>Connection: MySQL connection problem, fixed that by killing the program that was using that MySQL was supposed to use.</li>
                    <li>Codes not working when Hosted: My codes worked on the local server but were not working on the live server because I was using external files for common functions and fixed this problem by changing backward slash for directory to foward slash</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><b>Take-Aways: </b></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finishing this class, now I feel like I can make a website or an application that is meaningful, which has a functionality that I can think of. It made me feel more confident that I have tool and know how to use it to build whatever I want.</li>
                </ul>
